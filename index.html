          <h2>Swami Vivekananda Life Story</h2>
          <p>
              <b>Swami Vivekananda </b>(/ˈswɑːmi ˌvɪveɪˈkɑːnəndə/; Bengali: [ʃami bibekanɔndo] (listen); 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), 
              born Narendranath Datta (Bengali: [nɔrendronatʰ dɔto]), was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher,
              and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna.[4][5] He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to 
              the Western world[6][7][8] and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion.[9]

              Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion and spirituality. 
              He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a monk. After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent, 
              acquiring first-hand knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to help his 
              countrymen and found a way to travel to the United States, where he became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, 
              in which he began his famous speech with the words: Sisters and brothers of America... before introducing Hinduism to Americans.[10][11] 
              He was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest 
              figure at the Parliament".[12]

              After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States, England and Europe, 
              disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society 
              of Northern California),[13] both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West. In India, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math,
              which provides spiritual training for monastics and householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission that provides charity, social work and education.[7]

              Vivekananda was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary India, and the most successful missionaries of Vedanta to the
              Western world. He was also a major force in contemporary Hindu reform movements, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India.[14] He is now 
              widely regarded as one of the most influential people of modern India and a patriotic saint. His birthday in India is celebrated as National Youth Day.[15][16]

            Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened to Narendra or Naren)[18] in a Bengali family[19][20]
            in his ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta,[21] the capital of British India, on 12 January 
            1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival.[22] He belonged to a traditional family and was one of nine siblings.[23]
            His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court.[19][24] Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather 
            was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar[25] who left his family and became a monk at age twenty-five.[26] His mother, 
            Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife.[25] The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious
            temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality.[27][28] Narendranath was interested in spirituality 
            from a young age and used to meditate before the images of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman.[29] 
            He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks.[28] Narendra was mischievous and restless as a child, and his parents 
            often had difficulty controlling him. His mother said, "I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent me one of his demons".[26]
